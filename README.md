# Weather Dashboard

## This is a dynamically updated Weather dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When a user enters a City, that City's weather predictions will display for the current day and 5 following days.
The user will be able to view the UV Index and severity rating, wind speed, humidity, and temperature.

The user's inputs will be saved to the left sidebar, and when clicked, will revist the weather predictions for that city.

![The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for Atlanta.](assets\demo.png)
